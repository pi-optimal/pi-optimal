    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The managment of digital advertising campaigns is a complex and dynamic process, and still requires often human work to optimize the delivery of ads to maximize the desired outcome, such as smooth and evenly distributed impression delivery over time. By leveraging **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, we can optimize the delivery of ads to support or automate human campaign managment. This notebook demonstrates the use of `pi_optimal` to train an RL agent for **ad delivery optimization**, utilizing a dataset of historical ad data, about the campiagns delevery as well as the campaign manager's actions."

    "\n",
    "We aim to automate and optimize campaign management for a marketing agency specializing in regional online advertising. Due to the limited geographical scope, achieving smooth and consistent ad delivery over time presents a significant challenge. The agency has provided a dataset of historical ad delivery data. Leveraging `pi_optimal`, our goal is to train a reinforcement learning (RL) agent capable of:\n",

    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 57 adsets which data was collected between the 15th of July 2024 and 13th of November 2024. Every hour a snapshot of the adset state was taken, including the number of impressions delivered by the adset. The dataset also includes the actions taken by the campaign manager to adjust the adset delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AdSet General Information**:\n",
    "    - `created_at`: The date and time where the state and actions of the adset was recorded.\n",
    "    - `unit_index`: The unique identifier of the adset.\n",
    "    - `hour_of_day`: The hour of the day when the adset datapoint was recorded.\n",
    "    - `day_of_week`: The day of the week when the adset datapoint was recorded.\n",
    "    - `adset_name`: The name of the adset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **AdSet Delivery Information**:\n",
    "    - `adset_impressions_diff`: The number of impressions delivered in this hour.\n",
    "    - `adset_settings_total_budget`: The total budget of the adset.\n",
    "    - `adset_settings_daily_budget`: The daily budget of the adset.\n",
    "    - `adset_settings_maximum_daily_impressions`: The maximum number of impressions the adset can deliver in a day.\n",
    "    - `adset_settings_maximum_lifetime_impressions`: The maximum number of impressions the adset can deliver in its lifetime.\n",
    "    - `adset_settings_runtime_in_hours`: The total number of hours the adset is going to run.\n",
    "    - `adset_settings_remaining_hours`: The remaining number of hours the adset will run.\n",
    "    - `adset_settings_running_hours`: The number of hours the adset has been running.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Campaign Manager Actions**:\n",
    "    - `adset_settings_maximum_cpm`: The maximum CPM set for a specific hour by the campaign manager.\n",
    "    - `adset_targetings_frequency_capping_requests`: The frequency capping requests used by the campaign manager. Frequency capping is a feature that limits the number of times an ad is shown to the same user.\n",
    "    - `adset_settings_bidding_strategy`: The bidding strategy method.\n",
    "    - `adset_settings_pacing_type`: The pacing type of the campaign. Pacing is the rate at which the adset spends its budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **AdSet Delivery Metrics**:\n",
    "    - `total_missing_impressions`: The total number of missing impressions of the total number of impression.\n",
    "    - `expected_impression_next_hour`: The expected number of impressions the adset will deliver in the next hour.\n",
    "    - `hourly_missing_impressions`: The number of missing impressions in this hour."

    "To train a `pi_optimal` RL agent, we must first load and preprocess the ad dataset. The `pi_optimal` package provides a custom dataset class that streamlines the preprocessing pipeline. Below are the key parameters that need to be defined during this process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unit Index**:  \n",
    "   This parameter, `unit_index`, identifies distinct units in the dataset. In our case, each unit corresponds to unique adset (`unit_index` column).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Column**:  \n",
    "   The time column (`timestep_column`) establishes the temporal sequence of data points, enabling the model to learn from historical trends. For instance, the RL agent can consider the previous 24 hours of data (set by the `lookback_timesteps` parameter) to make informed decisions. In our case we would use the datetime column `created_at`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reward Column**:  \n",
    "   The `reward_column` specifies the target that the agent seeks to optimize. Here, we previously calculated and added the `reward` column to the dataset, which reflects just the distance between the current total impressions and the expected current impression given the progression of the campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State Columns**:  \n",
    "   The state columns capture the system's current status, it includes all variables that influence campaigns delivery performance. Relevant examples include:  \n",
    "   - `adset_targetings_total_population`  \n",
    "   - `adset_settings_total_budget`  \n",
    "   - `day_of_week`  \n",
    "   - ...\n",
    "\n",
    "   These features help the agent assess the current environment and predict outcomes effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Action Columns**:  \n",
    "   The action columns represent controllable variables, such as the CPM set or the frequency capping settingy. As you can see there are multiple action which we try to optimize at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "By carefully defining these parameters, we ensure that the RL agent can interpret the dataset's structure, learn from past patterns, and make optimized decisions to optimize adset delivery."

    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how `pi_optimal` could be used to optimize ad delivery for regional online advertising campaigns. By training a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent on historical ad data, we can automate and optimize ad campaigns, ensuring smooth and efficient ad delivery over time. The agent learns to make informed decisions based on the environment's behavior, enabling it to maximize the desired outcome and improve resource utilization."

    "\n",
    "- **Dataset Preparation**: We loaded and preprocessed the ad dataset, defining key parameters such as unit index, time column, reward column, state columns, and action columns.\n",
    "- **Data Type Agnostic Actions**: `pi_optimal` supports a wide range of actions, including continuous, discrete, and multi-dimensional actions. This flexibility allows you to model complex systems and optimize a variety of objectives. Especially in the context of ad tech, where multiple actions can be taken to optimize delivery."

    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fine-Tuning the Reward Function**: Experiment with different reward functions to further optimize ad delivery performance. For example, you could consider additional factors such as budget utilization, audience targeting, or campaign reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the agent's hyperparameters to enhance its performance and generalization capabilities. You could explore different neural network architectures, learning rates, or optimization algorithms to improve the agent's learning efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Real-Time Decision-Making**: Extend the agent's capabilities to support real-time decision-making. By integrating the agent with live data streams, you can optimize ad delivery in dynamic and rapidly changing environments."
